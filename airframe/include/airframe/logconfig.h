 *  Airframe Logging Configuration Support. Supplies glib log routing to
 *  standard error, file output, and the UNIX syslog facility, and the command
 *  line option processing necessary to use it. Integrates with daeconfig to
 *  ensure proper use of standard error, and to default to standard error or
 *  syslog as appropriate. Use this when your application uses glib logging
 *  and you want to give your users control over where to route logging
 *  information via the command line.
