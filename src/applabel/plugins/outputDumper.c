 *  This is used to banner grab the packets that it sees.  It is
 *  _extremely_ slow.  No attempt to make it fast & efficient has
 *  been made.  Don't expect to use this current implementation
 *  on a production system.  It is useful to process captures
 *  with this file and get ASCII text banners out that can
 *  be processed with other tools as needed.
